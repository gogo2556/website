<h3 id="history" class="histor">
    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.<br>
     Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. <br>
     Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); <br>
     gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; <br>
     rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.<br>
      These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.<br>

    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, <br>
    or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football <br>
    can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.<br>
     The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football<br> 
    to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.<br>
     By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football,<br>
     for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.<br>
      In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. <br>
     During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.<br>
